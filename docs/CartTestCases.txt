Feature: Cart Functionality
  As a user of the Sauce Labs Demo website
  I want to test cart-related features
  So that I can verify their behavior for different scenarios

  @cart
  Scenario: Add a product to the cart
    Given the user has logged in with "standard_user" and "secret_sauce"
    When the user clicks "Add to cart" for the "Sauce Labs Backpack"
    Then the cart count should increase to 1
    And the cart should display "Sauce Labs Backpack" as an item

  Scenario: Remove a product from the cart
    Given the user has added "Sauce Labs Backpack" to the cart
    When the user clicks "Remove" next to the product in the cart
    Then the cart should no longer display "Sauce Labs Backpack"
    And the cart count should decrease to 0

  Scenario: Validate product details in the cart
    Given the user has added "Sauce Labs Backpack" and "Sauce Labs Bike Light" to the cart
    When the user navigates to the cart page
    Then the cart should display:
      | Product Name           | Price    |
      | Sauce Labs Backpack    | $29.99   |
      | Sauce Labs Bike Light  | $9.99    |

  Scenario: Successful Checkout
    Given the user is logged in as "standard_user" with password "secret_sauce"
    And the user has added "Sauce Labs Backpack" to the cart
    When the user navigates to the cart page
    And proceeds to checkout
    And fills in the shipping details:
      | First Name | AutoQA  |
      | Last Name  | Test    |
      | Postal Code| 12345   |
    And clicks "Continue"
    And clicks "Finish"
    Then the user should see a confirmation message "Thank you for your order!"
