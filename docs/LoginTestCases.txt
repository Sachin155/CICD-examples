Feature: User Login Functionality
  As a user of the Sauce Labs Demo website
  I want to test login functionality
  So that I can verify how different user types behave on the platform

  Scenario: Successful login with a standard user
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "standard_user" as the username and "secret_sauce" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the products page
    And the page title should be "Products"

  Scenario: Attempt to login with a locked-out user
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "locked_out_user" as the username and "secret_sauce" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Sorry, this user has been locked out."

  Scenario: Successful login with a problem user
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "problem_user" as the username and "secret_sauce" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the products page
    But the product images may be broken

  Scenario: Successful login with a performance glitch user
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "performance_glitch_user" as the username and "secret_sauce" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the products page
    But the page load time may be delayed

  Scenario: Login without a username
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user leaves the username blank
    And enters "secret_sauce" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Username is required."

  Scenario: Login without a password
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "standard_user" as the username
    And leaves the password blank
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Password is required."

  Scenario: Login with invalid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "invalid_user" as the username
    And enters "wrong_password" as the password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message "Username and password do not match any user in this service."
